Lesson: Numbers in words

Create a webpage that translates numbers in numeric form into written words. For example, it would translate 384 into "three hundred eighty four".

Object will be very useful for this problem. Note, though, that you can't use the dot notation when a property's name is a number. To use a number as a key, you need to use the less-used square bracket syntax for retrieving and setting values:

var numbers = {1: "one"};

numbers[1] // returns "one"

numbers[2] = "two";


Start small, and then get your code working for numbers up to 1 trillion.
